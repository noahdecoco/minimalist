# minimalist

A simple, minimal todo app (with some optional super power features like storing priority and effort points and side notes).

# run in dev mode
## backend
cd into the root folder
run `docker-compose up --build` to start the backend server on port 6200

## frontend
cd into the client folder
run `npm run serve` to start the front end (vuejs)
